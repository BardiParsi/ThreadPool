# Thread Pool Concurrency Pattern in C++

A C++ project demonstrating the Thread Pool pattern for concurrency. 

## Introduction

This project showcases a C++ implementation of the Thread Pool pattern, a concurrency design pattern used for managing and executing multiple tasks concurrently by efficiently distributing them among a fixed number of threads. The program smartly distributes threads equally among the heavy tasks to implement them concurrently, thus optimizing resource utilization and enhancing overall performance.

## Features

- **Thread Pool Pattern:** Efficiently manages multiple heavy tasks by distributing them among a fixed number of threads.
- **Concurrency:** Implements heavy tasks concurrently, optimizing resource utilization.
- **Smart Thread Distribution:** Equally distributes threads among the heavy tasks, ensuring efficient task execution.

## Requirements

- C++20 or above
- This project is tested and compatible with the following compilers:
    Mingw g++
    Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
